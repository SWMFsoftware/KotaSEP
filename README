Dave,

here I send some files. I wanted to make the description in PDF 
with a friendlier format -- but that has not been converging owing to
my PPT skill, ie the lack of it. So i resort to plain text in
describing the vasic structure of teh code. The code, as you can see,
is still under development. I tried to remove a lot of branches 
that are dead leftovers, or still potential ways but not used at
present, either way. Beacuse of this developing stage I tried to improve
but it is still not vlean and well commented.

What i attach are;

1.) fortran code   : sep19.f
2.) violet.in      : input data for computation
3.) evolv1.cme     : this is very large. It is essentially Chip's
                     simulation for one field line. I'll send in a
                     separate mail 
4.) Code.txt       : textfile describing the structure of the code

I continue working on the documentation in the next few days

Looking forward seeing you
Jozsef
